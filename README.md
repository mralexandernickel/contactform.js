contactform.js
==============

this will be a contactform generated and configured through javascript, using mandrill to send emails, ReCaptcha to validate Humans and jquery.validate.js to validate user input. using twitter bootstrap classes for styling, but until this is no dependency...

as soon as this plugin is stable this repository will also hold a directory named "dist" where you will find the precompiled templates and the jquery-plugin in javascript

## NOTICE

Pre-Alpha!!!
